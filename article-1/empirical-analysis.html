            <h2>4. Empirical Analysis and Results</h2>

            <h3>4.1 Bitcoin Dominance Trends Over Time</h3>
            <p>
                Our first empirical investigation examines the longitudinal evolution of Bitcoin dominance from 2013 to
                2025. Figure 1 presents annual average BTC dominance with range bands showing intra-year volatility.
            </p>

                    bands.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <strong>Key Finding 1:</strong> Bitcoin dominance exhibits a clear cyclical pattern rather than
                monotonic decline. BTC.D compressed from 93.3% (2013) to a cyclical low of 39.3% (2022) during peak alt
                season, but recovered to 59.3% by 2025. This U-shaped recovery pattern suggests cyclically bounded
                dilution within broader structural pressures.
            </div>

            <p>
                The data reveals several distinct phases:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2013-2016 (Early Dominance):</strong> BTC.D averaged 82-93%, reflecting Bitcoin's
                    near-monopoly status in the nascent cryptocurrency ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>2017-2018 (First Alt Season):</strong> Sharp BTC.D compression to 44.6% average (low of
                    31.1%) during the ICO boom, as thousands of new tokens captured speculative capital.</li>
                <li><strong>2019-2020 (Recovery Phase):</strong> BTC.D recovery to 60-63% during crypto winter as failed
                    ICOs collapsed and capital returned to Bitcoin as safe haven.</li>
                <li><strong>2021-2022 (Second Alt Season):</strong> BTC.D declined again to 39.3% during DeFi/NFT mania,
                    marking the lowest dominance in Bitcoin's history.</li>
                <li><strong>2023-2025 (Institutional Phase):</strong> Steady BTC.D recovery to 59.3% coinciding with
                    spot ETF approvals and institutional adoption, suggesting quality-based capital consolidation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.2 Altcoin Proliferation and Market Fragmentation</h3>
            <p>
                The exponential growth in cryptocurrency supply represents the supply-side driver of the Capital
                Dilution Effect. Figure 2 illustrates the dramatic expansion in both total and active cryptocurrencies.
            </p>

            <div class="chart-container">
                <div class="chart-title">Figure 2: Cryptocurrency Supply Growth (2013-2025)</div>
                <canvas id="altcoinGrowthChart"></canvas>
                <div class="chart-caption">
                    Source: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap. "Active" cryptocurrencies defined here as those with ≥$100k 30-day
                    average daily trading volume.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <strong>Key Finding 2:</strong> The cryptocurrency universe expanded from 50 assets in 2013 to over
                17,000 by 2025—a 340x increase. Even conservative estimates of "active" cryptocurrencies show 300x
                growth (50 to 15,000 assets), demonstrating sustained market fragmentation.
            </div>

            <p>
                This explosive growth validates the supply-side component of our CDE hypothesis. The market now offers
                thousands of competing investment vehicles, each vying for limited investor attention and capital. While
                most altcoins remain insignificant individually, their collective presence creates a persistent dilutive
                force by fragmenting the total addressable market. As of November 2025, real-time market data confirms
                Bitcoin's dominance at 58.72% of the $3.94 trillion total cryptocurrency market cap, with Ethereum
                holding 12.79% and Solana 2.81%. The altcoin market (excluding Bitcoin) represents $610.9 billion in
                value, distributed across thousands of assets with varying degrees of liquidity and adoption
                (Slickcharts, DemandSage, 2025).
            </p>

            <h3>4.3 Correlation Analysis: Altcoin Supply vs. Bitcoin Dominance</h3>
            <p>
                To test the direct relationship between altcoin proliferation and Bitcoin dominance erosion, Figure 3
                presents a dual-axis time series comparing cryptocurrency supply growth with BTC.D trends.
            </p>

            <div class="chart-container">
                <div class="chart-title">Figure 3: Inverse Relationship Between Altcoin Supply and BTC Dominance</div>
                <canvas id="correlationChart"></canvas>
                <div class="chart-caption">
                    Dual-axis chart showing negative correlation between rising altcoin count (left axis) and declining
                    BTC dominance (right axis, inverted scale).
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <strong>Key Finding 3:</strong> Visual inspection reveals an inverse relationship between altcoin supply
                growth and Bitcoin dominance, with a moderately strong negative sample correlation in our dataset (see
                the Figure 3 caption for the computed r). This supports the CDE hypothesis, though the relationship is
                clearly moderated by cyclical market dynamics.
            </div>

            <p>
                However, the correlation is not perfectly linear, suggesting that other variables moderate the
                relationship:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality Filtering:</strong> Most new altcoins fail to capture meaningful market
                    share; only top-tier projects (Ethereum, Solana, etc.) significantly impact BTC.D.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> Risk appetite fluctuations cause capital to alternately
                    embrace or flee from altcoin exposure.</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional Behavior:</strong> Professional investors apply rigorous due
                    diligence, filtering out 95%+ of altcoins and concentrating capital in Bitcoin and a handful
                    of proven alternatives.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.4 Year-over-Year Dominance Changes and Market Cycles</h3>
            <p>
                Analyzing year-over-year changes in Bitcoin dominance reveals the cyclical nature of capital
                dilution effects.
            </p>

            <div class="chart-container">
                <div class="chart-title">Figure 4: Year-over-Year Changes in Bitcoin Dominance</div>
                <canvas id="yoyChangeChart"></canvas>
                <div class="chart-caption">
                    Positive values indicate BTC dominance gains; negative values indicate alt season dilution
                    effects.
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                The bar chart clearly illustrates alternating phases of dilution and recovery:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Major Dilution Periods:</strong> 2017 (-24.1%), 2021 (-15.1%), and 2022 (-8.3%)
                    correspond to speculative bull markets and alt seasons.</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery Periods:</strong> 2019 (+15.6%), 2023 (+6.3%), 2024 (+6.3%), and 2025
                    (+7.4%) correspond to bear market recoveries and flight-to-quality phases.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <strong>Key Finding 4:</strong> Capital Dilution Effect operates cyclically rather than
                linearly. During risk-on bull markets, BTC.D declines sharply as speculative capital chases
                altcoin gains. During risk-off corrections, natural market mechanisms eliminate weak projects
                and capital reconsolidates in Bitcoin, causing BTC.D recovery.

            <h3>4.5 Cryptocurrency User Distribution Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Beyond market capitalization metrics, examining user distribution provides insights into
                fundamental adoption patterns. Table 1 presents global cryptocurrency ownership data for
                2023-2024.

            <div class="key-finding">
                <strong>Key Finding 5:</strong> Bitcoin maintains remarkably stable user dominance at ~51%
                despite massive altcoin proliferation. This suggests that while capital may be diluted across
                thousands of assets, fundamental user adoption and trust remain concentrated in Bitcoin,
                supporting its long-term store of value thesis.
