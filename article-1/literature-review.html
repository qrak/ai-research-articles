            <h2>2. Literature Review and Conceptual Foundations</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Bitcoin as Store of Value: Foundational Arguments</h3>
            <p>
                The conception of Bitcoin as "digital gold" and store of value derives from Satoshi Nakamoto's original
                whitepaper (2008) and subsequent economic analysis. Key arguments supporting this thesis include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> A mathematically enforced supply limit of 21 million BTC, contrasting
                    with fiat currencies subject to inflationary expansion (Ammous, 2018).</li>
                <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Bitcoin's protocol is theoretically indestructible without complete
                    collapse of its peer-to-peer network spanning thousands of nodes globally.</li>
                <li><strong>Divisibility:</strong> Each BTC unit divides into 100 million satoshis, enabling
                    microtransactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Value transfer without physical transportation requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Empirical studies (Wójcik, 2020; Hanley, 2018) suggest that institutional investors increasingly
                perceive Bitcoin in store-of-value terms, similar to gold in hedging portfolios. The approval of spot
                Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 marked a watershed moment, formalizing Bitcoin's role in traditional finance and
                catalyzing substantial inflows and assets under management throughout 2024–2025.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 Altcoin Explosion and Bitcoin Dominance Dynamics</h3>
            <p>
                Market data documents a dramatic empirical phenomenon: In 2017, Bitcoin dominance fell below 40% as
                total altcoin count exceeded 1,500 (Coinbase Research, 2018). During the 2021 peak "alt season," BTC.D
                compressed to approximately 40% while DeFi and NFT tokens generated over $100 billion in market
                capitalization. Conversely, during the 2022-2023 bear market, Bitcoin dominance recovered to ~50% as
                most altcoins lost 80-99% of their value (CoinMarketCap, 2023).
            </p>
            <p>
                These observations suggest that CDE exhibits strong <strong>cyclical modulation</strong> atop longer-run
                structural pressures, implying potential for natural self-regulation through market forces.
            </p>

            <h3>2.3 Alt Season Dynamics: Market Cycle Theory</h3>
            <p>
                The term <span class="highlight">"alt season"</span> refers to periods when speculative capital
                massively rotates from Bitcoin into altcoins, generating extraordinary returns for altcoin investors
                while simultaneously depressing Bitcoin dominance. Technical studies (Hirshleifer & Shumway, 2003;
                Schachter & Siddarth, 2021) document that speculative cryptocurrency bull markets are driven by:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):</strong> Retail investor influx motivated by fear of missing
                    profit opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Halving Effect:</strong> Bitcoin halving events (50% reduction in mining rewards
                    approximately every 4 years) that traditionally precede bull markets and amplify FOMO.</li>
                <li><strong>Narrative Shift:</strong> Media narrative transitions from "Bitcoin is the future" to
                    "Ethereum and DeFi are the future" (or other emerging categories).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                During bear phases, capital returns to Bitcoin as a "safe haven" asset, driving BTC.D recovery. This
                cyclical pattern suggests inherent market stabilization mechanisms. The <strong>Altseason
                    Index</strong>, which tracks how many of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day
                rolling period, provides quantitative measurement of these cycles. XBTFX (2025) reported the index
                recently breached the key 75 threshold, indicating that a significant majority of top-performing
                altcoins were outpacing Bitcoin. Bitget data (Nov 2025) shows 54 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies
                outperformed BTC in the past 90 days—a 54% rate that falls short of the traditional 75% "alt season"
                designation, suggesting the market is in a transitional phase between Bitcoin dominance and full altcoin
                rotation.
            </p>

            <h3>2.4 Regulatory Approaches: Intervention vs. Self-Regulation</h3>

            <h4>2.4.1 Interventionist School</h4>
            <p>
                Proponents of government regulation (Rogoff, 2023; International Monetary Fund, 2023) argue that
                regulatory frameworks—including registration requirements, audits, and disclosure mandates—would reduce
                fraud incidents and "rug pulls" (projects where founders abscond with investor capital), strengthen
                market stability, and enhance consumer protection. The European Union's MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets)
                regulation exemplifies this interventionist approach.
            </p>

            <h4>2.4.2 Free Market School (Cypherpunk Tradition)</h4>
            <p>
                Self-regulation advocates (Ammous, 2018; Antonopoulos, 2014) argue that cryptocurrencies emerged as a
                decentralized alternative to government-controlled financial systems (cypherpunk ideology). They contend
                that rigorous regulation may stifle innovation and lead to regulatory arbitrage (project migration to
                less-regulated jurisdictions). Risk, they argue, is a natural element of innovation; investors should
                bear responsibility for project verification. The market self-regulates through: (a) failure of weak
                projects, (b) capital migration to quality, and (c) cyclical corrections.
