            <h3>3.3 Data Sources and Period</h3>
            <p>
                Our primary data encompasses the period from 2013 to 2025, capturing the evolution from Bitcoin's early
                dominance through multiple market cycles including the 2017-2018 ICO boom, the 2020-2021 DeFi/NFT surge,
                the 2022 bear market, and the 2024-2025 institutional adoption phase via ETFs.
            </p>

            <h3>3.4 Methodological Limitations</h3>

            <h4>3.4.1 Incomplete On-Chain Data: Quantifying the Invisible Market</h4>
            <p>
                A significant methodological challenge involves capital flows that remain opaque due to
                privacy-enhancing features and off-chain transactions. Recent blockchain analytics research (2025)
                demonstrates that comprehensive data collection has substantially improved, with platforms like Dune
                Analytics, Flipside Crypto, and Arkham Intelligence now providing SQL-based querying and real-time
                analytics across Bitcoin, Ethereum, EVM, and non-EVM blockchains. However, critical blind spots persist:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Privacy Coins:</strong> As of 2025, the privacy coin sector (led by Monero and Zcash)
                    represents approximately $14.3 billion in market capitalization—a relatively small fraction (~0.7%)
                    of Bitcoin's $2 trillion market cap. While Zcash surged to $388 (an 8-year high) with a $6.2 billion
                    market cap in late 2024, privacy coin transaction volumes remain deliberately opaque by design,
                    employing ring signatures (Monero) and zero-knowledge proofs (Zcash) that obscure sender, receiver,
                    and transaction amounts. This creates an estimated 1-2% data gap in total crypto market visibility.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Volume:</strong> DEX trading has exploded, with Q2 2025 data
                    showing $876.3 billion in spot trading volume (up 25% quarter-over-quarter) and average weekly
                    volume of $18.6 billion. Uniswap commands 35.9% market share ($111.8 billion monthly), while
                    PancakeSwap achieved record $310 billion annual volume in 2024 (179% year-over-year growth). DEX
                    perpetual futures reached $898 billion in Q2 2025, dominated by Hyperliquid (73% market share).
                    While DEX analytics have dramatically improved, unique wallet counts (9.7 million mid-2025, up from
                    6.8 million) represent only a fraction of actual trading activity due to multi-wallet strategies and
                    automated trading bots.</li>

                <li><strong>Off-Chain Transactions:</strong> British Accounting Review research (2025) examining Bitcoin
                    market efficiency from 2014-2022 confirms that off-chain factors (liquidity and investor attention)
                    interact significantly with on-chain metrics (active wallets, transaction fees, transaction volume).
                    Layer-2 solutions (Lightning Network, Liquid Network) and centralized exchange internal transfers
                    remain partially untracked, though their impact on Bitcoin dominance calculations is mitigated by
                    the fact that BTC.D is computed from market capitalization rather than transaction volume.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Mitigation Strategy:</strong> We triangulate data from multiple sources (CoinMarketCap,
                CoinGecko, Glassnode, DefiLlama) and focus our analysis on market capitalization-based dominance
                metrics, which aggregate price × supply and are less vulnerable to off-chain transaction opacity than
                volume-based metrics. The growing accessibility of on-chain analytics tools across multiple blockchain
                ecosystems reduces but does not eliminate this limitation.
            </p>

            <h4>3.4.2 Endogeneity and Causality: Disentangling Correlation from Cause</h4>
            <p>
                The fundamental challenge of distinguishing causation from correlation pervades cryptocurrency market
                analysis. The core question—<em>Does altcoin proliferation cause Bitcoin dominance decline, or does
                    Bitcoin dominance decline create conditions that attract altcoin investment?</em>—remains difficult
                to resolve definitively. Recent econometric research provides methodological frameworks for addressing
                this challenge:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Granger Causality Testing:</strong> Multiple studies employ Granger causality tests to
                    examine temporal precedence in cryptocurrency markets. Research analyzing Bitcoin's relationship
                    with macroeconomic variables, gold prices, and M2 money supply demonstrates that Granger causality
                    can identify whether changes in one variable systematically precede changes in another. Studies
                    examining Bitcoin-altcoin dynamics through network analysis reveal complex interdependencies, with
                    Bitcoin typically exhibiting high "in-degree" (receiving causal influences) and "out-degree"
                    (exerting causal influences) in cryptocurrency networks.</li>

                <li><strong>Reflexivity and Endogeneity Indices:</strong> Mark et al. (2022) developed a "reflexivity
                    index" to quantify activity generated endogenously within cryptocurrency markets, measuring the
                    extent to which market movements are self-reinforcing versus driven by external factors. This
                    approach acknowledges that cryptocurrency markets exhibit significant endogenous dynamics—price
                    movements trigger narrative shifts that attract capital flows, creating feedback loops that
                    complicate causal inference.</li>

                <li><strong>Instrumental Variables Approach:</strong> Addressing endogeneity requires identifying
                    exogenous instrumental variables correlated with altcoin supply growth but not directly affecting
                    Bitcoin dominance through other channels. Potential instruments include: (1) regulatory
                    announcements affecting token issuance costs, (2) blockchain technology breakthroughs enabling new
                    token standards (ERC-20 in 2017, BRC-20 in 2023), and (3) venture capital funding cycles in
                    blockchain startups. However, valid instruments remain challenging to identify given the
                    interconnected nature of crypto ecosystem developments.</li>

                <li><strong>Macro-Micro Factor Integration:</strong> Recent research (2025) demonstrates that
                    integrating diverse data sources—technical indicators, on-chain metrics, sentiment indicators,
                    traditional market indices, and macroeconomic indicators—substantially improves cryptocurrency
                    forecasting accuracy. On-chain metrics prove paramount for both short-term and long-term
                    predictions, while traditional market indices and macroeconomic indicators gain relevance for
                    longer-term forecasts. This suggests that Bitcoin dominance dynamics result from complex
                    interactions between crypto-specific factors and broader financial market conditions, further
                    complicating causal identification.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Our Approach:</strong> Rather than claiming definitive causal direction, we acknowledge
                bidirectional feedback mechanisms. We present correlation analysis (Pearson r = -0.92 between altcoin
                supply and BTC dominance) as descriptive evidence of association, while carefully avoiding causal
                language. We triangulate multiple analytical approaches—time-series analysis of market cycles,
                year-over-year dominance changes, institutional capital allocation patterns—to build a circumstantial
                case that altcoin proliferation represents a structural force rather than merely a consequence of
                Bitcoin weakness. Future research employing panel data methods, quasi-experimental designs around
                regulatory shocks, or machine learning approaches to causal inference could strengthen causal claims
                beyond our current correlational framework.
            </p>

            <h4>3.4.3 Limited Historical Data</h4>
            <p>
                The cryptocurrency market's ~16-year existence constrains long-term trend analysis and limits our
                ability to distinguish secular trends from super-cycles. Traditional financial markets benefit from
                century-long datasets enabling identification of multi-decade patterns; cryptocurrency markets provide
                barely more than one full economic cycle (2009-2025), spanning only two Federal Reserve rate-hiking
                cycles and three major bear markets.
