            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

            <h3>1.1 Research Context and Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has been positioned in academic literature as a potential store of
                value and hedge against fiat currency inflation. Its fundamental proposition rests on a permanently
                fixed supply cap of 21 million units, contrasting sharply with traditional currencies subject to
                monetary expansion by central banks (Nakamoto, 2008; Szabo, 2005). This digital scarcity was designed to
                replicate gold's properties in the digital realm, establishing Bitcoin as "digital gold" and a long-term
                store of value.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, beginning approximately in 2011, the cryptocurrency market has witnessed explosive growth in
                alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), tokens, and blockchain projects. As of 2025, the market
                encompasses over 17,000 registered cryptographic assets, raising a critical empirical question:
                <strong>Does the massive proliferation of altcoins disperse limited investment capital that would
                    otherwise flow to Bitcoin, thereby weakening its short-term growth potential and market
                    dominance?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                This question is not merely academic—it strikes at the heart of Bitcoin's value proposition. If capital
                dilution is a permanent structural feature rather than a temporary cyclical phenomenon, Bitcoin's role
                as the premier cryptocurrency reserve asset may be fundamentally challenged, with profound implications
                for institutional adoption strategies, portfolio allocation models, and the broader evolution of the
                digital asset ecosystem.
            </p>

            <h3>1.2 The Capital Dilution Effect: Theoretical Framework</h3>
            <p>
                In classical equity markets, dilution refers to the decline in per-share value resulting from the
                issuance of new shares, which dilutes the holdings of existing shareholders. We adapt this concept to
                cryptocurrency markets through our central hypothesis: the <span class="highlight">Capital Dilution
                    Effect (CDE)</span>.
            </p>

            <div class="methodology-box">
                <h4>Hypothesis: Capital Dilution Effect (CDE)</h4>
                <p>The CDE hypothesis posits five interconnected propositions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Capital Boundedness:</strong> The total pool of capital available for cryptocurrency
                        investment over any given time period is limited from a macroeconomic perspective, bounded by
                        global liquidity conditions, risk appetite, and competitive investment opportunities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supply-Driven Dispersion:</strong> The proliferation of altcoins and decentralized
                        projects (DeFi, NFTs, memecoins) causes systematic dispersion of this bounded capital across an
                        expanding asset base.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proportional Dilution:</strong> As a mathematical consequence, the proportion of capital
                        allocated to Bitcoin decreases, manifested empirically as declining Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D),
                        defined as the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to total cryptocurrency market
                        capitalization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cyclical Intensification:</strong> This effect intensifies during speculative bull
                        markets or "alt seasons," when retail investors chase high-risk altcoins promising exponential
                        returns, causing severe BTC.D compression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bear Market Reversal:</strong> The effect naturally attenuates during bear markets when
                        risk-averse capital migrates from failed altcoins back to relatively stable assets (Bitcoin,
                        Ethereum, stablecoins), causing BTC.D recovery.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>
                This formulation draws parallels to supply saturation effects observed in equity markets. Research on
                "crypto stocks" demonstrates that rapid exhaustion of valuation premiums, funding channel collapse, and
                narrative breakdown can trigger price crashes and negative feedback loops (analogous to market crashes).
                In cryptocurrency markets, the continuous mass supply of new tokens replicates this structure, creating
                systematic pressure toward capital fragmentation.
            </p>

            <h3>1.3 Central Thesis: Market Self-Regulation vs. Government Intervention</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>This paper advances the thesis that free market mechanisms—rather than government
                    intervention—represent the most efficient regulators of the Capital Dilution Effect in the long
                    term.</strong> We argue that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Market self-regulation through natural bankruptcy of weak altcoins</li>
                <li>Migration of institutional capital to high-quality, liquid assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum)</li>
                <li>Cyclical market corrections (bear markets) that eliminate speculative excess</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These mechanisms constitute sufficient regulatory forces to mitigate CDE without requiring government
                intervention, which could simultaneously suppress innovation and violate foundational principles of
                decentralization.
            </p>
            <p>
                We propose that <strong>government's role should be limited to:</strong> (1) combating financial fraud
                and crime, (2) establishing clear taxation rules, and (3) public education—rather than intervening in
                token classification or restricting altcoin creation. This position aligns with classical liberal
                economic thought (Smith, Hayek, Friedman) emphasizing market-based solutions and minimal intervention in
                innovative sectors.
