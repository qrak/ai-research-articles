- **[The Capital Dilution Effect and the Erosion of Bitcoin Dominance](https://qrak.github.io/ai-research-articles/article-1/index.html)**  
  A comprehensive study examining the Capital Dilution Effect (CDE), where the proliferation of altcoins disperses investment capital away from Bitcoin, eroding its market dominance. The analysis covers market data from 2013-2025, identifying structural forces and cyclical patterns in cryptocurrency market fragmentation. Key findings include Bitcoin dominance declining from 93.3% to 59.3%, with three distinct phases of capital dilution: speculation-driven alt seasons, risk-off safe haven dynamics, and institutional diversification through regulated products. The study concludes that while Bitcoin's store of value thesis remains viable, its dominance faces ongoing pressure from competing digital assets, with free market mechanisms providing more effective regulation than government intervention.
